# Planned Improvements for v2

## Performance improvements

Investigate if web-workers can be used to improve selection performance. Currently >=25k nodes causes huge lags.

## Add drag-ability

This one is huge. Huge effort = huge reward. So ideally after a selection, a user should be able to dragNdrop the selection (i.e. by moving on an already selected node). Maybe the dragNdrop library can be re-used (not sure).

A user should be able to disable that functionality if he does not want it
